# Power BI & Fabric Analytics

Microsoft Power BI spans Desktop (authoring DAX measures, Power Query M transforms, and report design into .pbix/.pbip files), the Power BI Service (cloud publishing, workspaces, REST API management at `api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/`), Power BI Embedded (embed tokens for custom apps), and Microsoft Fabric (OneLake Lakehouse storage, PySpark notebooks, data pipelines, Dataflow Gen2, and Direct Lake semantic models that read Delta tables without import refresh).

## DAX

- Use CALCULATE to modify filter context; prefer direct column filters over FILTER on large tables.
- Apply VAR/RETURN to eliminate repeated sub-expressions and improve readability.
- Use DIVIDE() instead of `/` for safe division; use KEEPFILTERS to preserve slicer context when needed.
- Implement time intelligence (TOTALYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, DATEADD) against a contiguous marked date table.
- Prefer measures over calculated columns; use calculated columns only for slicers, sorts, or relationships.
- Consult `references/dax-patterns.md` for function signatures, KPI patterns, and best-practice rules.

## Power Query M

- Structure every query as `let/in` with named steps; set explicit column types as the final step.
- Maximize query folding by placing SelectRows, SelectColumns, and Sort before custom transforms.
- Use `Web.Contents` with `RelativePath`/`Query` for proper credential handling; use `List.Generate` for REST pagination.
- Apply `try/otherwise` for operations that may fail on individual rows.
- Consult `references/power-query-m.md` for source connectors, transform functions, folding rules, and parameters.

## Semantic Model

- Design star schemas with single-direction many-to-one relationships from dimensions to facts.
- Use bi-directional relationships sparingly; activate inactive relationships via USERELATIONSHIP().
- Implement dynamic RLS with USERPRINCIPALNAME() and test with "View as Role" before publishing.
- Choose the correct storage mode: Import for speed, DirectQuery for real-time, Direct Lake for Fabric.
- Organize measures into display folders and define drill-down hierarchies on dimension tables.

## Fabric

- Follow the medallion pattern: Bronze (raw ingest) -> Silver (cleaned) -> Gold (star schema) -> Direct Lake semantic model.
- Use Lakehouse shortcuts to reference external ADLS/S3/GCS storage without copying data.
- Use Dataflow Gen2 to land Power Query transforms directly into Lakehouse Delta tables.
- Monitor Direct Lake fallback to DirectQuery when data exceeds memory or unsupported features are used.
- Consult `references/fabric-integration.md` for Lakehouse, notebook, pipeline, and Direct Lake details.

## REST API

- Authenticate with Azure AD tokens scoped to `https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default` (PBI) or `https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/.default` (Fabric).
- Handle async operations (refresh, export) by polling the status endpoint until completion.
- Implement exponential backoff for 429 (throttled) responses; re-acquire tokens on 401.
- Use the admin APIs (`/admin/`) for tenant-wide operations; use deployment pipeline APIs for ALM promotion.
- Consult `references/pbi-rest-api.md` for all endpoint paths, request bodies, and error codes.

## Embedded

- Choose "App Owns Data" (service principal) for customer-facing embeds or "User Owns Data" (delegated) for internal portals.
- Generate embed tokens with RLS identities when the dataset enforces row-level security.
- Use the multi-resource `/GenerateToken` endpoint to embed multiple reports/datasets in one token.
- Register the service principal in Azure AD and enable it in the Power BI Admin Portal tenant settings.

## Output Formats

- Prefix every DAX measure with a header comment block: Measure Name, Description, Dependencies.
- Generate Power Query M with explicit `Table.TransformColumnTypes` as the final step.
- Scaffold PBIP projects with correct folder structure (.pbip, .Dataset/definition/, .Report/definition/) and TMDL files.
- Consult `references/pbip-format.md` for TMDL syntax, model.bim schema, and Git workflow conventions.
