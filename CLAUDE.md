# CLAUDE.md

## Project Summary

Claude-m is a Microsoft plugin marketplace for Claude Code. It provides 100+ knowledge plugins covering Azure, M365, Fabric, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and security — all installable via the Claude Code plugin system.

**Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js (ESM), MCP SDK, Zod, Jest

## Commands & Workflows

```bash
npm test              # Run tests
npm run lint          # Type-check
npm run build         # Build TypeScript
npm run sync          # Sync plugin descriptions into marketplace.json + CLAUDE.md
npm run setup         # Scaffold .claude + docs/context structure
npm run deploy        # Full pipeline: sync, setup, validate, build, test
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add markus41/Claude-m

# 2. Install a plugin
/plugin install microsoft-azure-mcp@claude-m-microsoft-marketplace
```

## Troubleshooting: SSH auth error

If you see `git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)` when adding the marketplace,
Git is trying SSH but no key is configured. Fix it by switching to HTTPS:

```bash
git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf "git@github.com:"
```

Then re-run `/plugin marketplace add markus41/Claude-m`.
