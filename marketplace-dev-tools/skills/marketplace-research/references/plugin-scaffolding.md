# Plugin Scaffolding Reference

## Overview

This reference documents the canonical directory structure, file formats, frontmatter schemas, and conventions for creating new Claude-m marketplace plugins. It is the authoritative guide for the `marketplace-dev-tools` skill when scaffolding new plugins or reviewing existing ones for compliance.

# <Agent Display Name>

## Trigger Scenarios

- <When to invoke this agent>
- <Another scenario>

trigger: setup | teardown | pre-command | post-command
description: What this hook does
skill: skill-name
---

# Hook: <Name>

## Reference File Naming Conventions

| Pattern | Use For | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `<entity>-operations.md` | CRUD operations for a primary entity | `message-operations.md` |
| `<protocol>-reference.md` | Protocol or API reference | `fetchxml-reference.md` |
| `<feature>-patterns.md` | Design patterns | `retry-patterns.md` |
| `<service>-reference.md` | Service-specific deep dive | `exchange-reference.md` |
| `operational-knowledge.md` | Limits, errors, troubleshooting | `operational-knowledge.md` |
| `authentication.md` | Auth flows and credential setup | `authentication.md` |

---

## MCP Server Integration Pattern

For plugins that expose tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP):

```json
// .claude-plugin/plugin.json addition
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "my-service-mcp",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@publisher/my-service-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "MY_SERVICE_API_KEY": "${MY_SERVICE_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Progressive Disclosure Implementation Guide

Every plugin SKILL.md should end with a "Progressive Disclosure — Reference Files" section:

```markdown
## Progressive Disclosure — Reference Files

| Topic | File |
|---|---|
| Operational knowledge (errors, limits, safe defaults) | [`references/operational-knowledge.md`](./references/operational-knowledge.md) |
| Core entity operations | [`references/entity-operations.md`](./references/entity-operations.md) |
| Authentication and permissions | [`references/authentication.md`](./references/authentication.md) |
```

**Reference file quality standard:**
- 200–500 lines
- Full REST API/SDK endpoint tables (Method, Endpoint, Permissions, Parameters, Notes)
- Complete TypeScript/PowerShell/Python code examples
- Error codes table (Code, Meaning, Remediation)
- Limits table (Resource, Limit, Notes)
- Common patterns and gotchas section (at least 5–10 items)

---

## Validation Checklist for New Plugins

```bash
# Run built-in validation
npm run validate:all

# Manual checklist:
# [ ] plugin.json has all required fields (name, version, description, skills, commands)
# [ ] SKILL.md has valid frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools, triggers)
# [ ] At least one command file with valid frontmatter
# [ ] README.md exists and has installation instructions
# [ ] All file paths in plugin.json exist on disk
# [ ] No Windows-style CRLF line endings (use LF)
# [ ] All code snippets are syntactically valid
# [ ] Triggers list covers primary use cases (at least 5 phrases)
# [ ] Progressive disclosure section in SKILL.md
# [ ] Reference files are 200–500 lines
# [ ] No hardcoded secrets or real credentials in examples
# [ ] CLAUDE.md table updated with new plugin entry
```

---

## Common Scaffolding Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Validation fails on `plugin.json` | Missing required field | Check schema; add `name`, `version`, `description` |
| SKILL.md frontmatter parse error | YAML syntax error | Validate YAML; check for unescaped colons in strings |
| Command not found in plugin | `commands` array in `plugin.json` missing entry | Add `{ "name": "...", "path": "commands/..." }` |
| Skill triggers not matching | Triggers too specific or misspelled | Use common synonyms; include entity names and operation verbs |
| Reference file not linked | Missing from SKILL.md progressive disclosure table | Add row to the table at bottom of SKILL.md |
| Line ending errors | Files saved with CRLF on Windows | Run `git config core.autocrlf false`; convert with `dos2unix` |
| Plugin install fails | Repository URL incorrect in marketplace.json | Verify GitHub repository path and branch |

---

## Limits

| Resource | Limit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SKILL.md size | No hard limit; recommend < 2,000 lines | Split into references if larger |
| Reference file size | 200–500 lines target | < 200 = insufficient; > 500 = split into multiple files |
| Triggers per skill | No hard limit; recommend 8–20 | Too few = missed activations; too many = false positives |
| Commands per plugin | No hard limit | Each command needs a separate `.md` file |
| Plugin name length | 64 characters | Used in install slug |
| Plugin version | Semantic versioning required | e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.3` |
| MCP server args | No hard limit | Keep startup args minimal |
